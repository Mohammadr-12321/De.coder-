# De.coder-
algorithm design final project(find and print shortest path between nodes.find and print all simple paths between two nodes in ascending)


implement graph with adjacency matrix

use priority queue data structure to increase algorithm performance 

implement priority queue data structure with min heap tree data structure

use Stack data structure to store all paths between two nodes

use merge sort algorithm for sorting all simple paths between two nodes
